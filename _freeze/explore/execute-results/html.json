Use the procedure ID again, but account for thbis in the meta-analysis syntax. Also then talk about how this is not per study, but per manipulation instead\n\n### Hierachical Bayesian Model\n\nTo illustrate the benefits of our large collection of trial-level data, we applied Bayesian multilevel models predicting truth judgments with repetition as a fixed effect and random intercepts and slopes at the subject, statement, and procedure levels. We chose to use the procedure level instead of the study level as meaningful study characteristics regarding the truth effect are captured in this part of the data. For example, the same study may have multiple judgment sessions, modify the percentage of repeated stimuli, or warn some participants about the truth effect. These different procedures will then also receive different procedure identifiers. The present analysis allows us to estimate the variance in the truth effect on three levels simultaneously: variance introduced through experimental manipulations (procedure_id), variance introduced through statements (statement_id), and variance due to individual differences (subject).\n\nWe analyzed the dichotomous and Likert-type response formats separately due to differences in their scale characteristics. Dichotomous responses (e.g., true/false) require logistic models, whereas Likert-type responses (e.g., 1–5 ratings) allow for linear models. All responses were maximum-normalized to the range 0-1 with one representing the maximum possible response indicating a \"true\" judgment. The repetition status was mean-centered to aid model estimation, a new statement was coded -0.5 and a repeated statement 0.5.\n\nWe ran all models using 4 chains with 3000 iterations per chain, 1000 of which were discarded as warmup-samples, leading to a total of 8000 posterior samples. There were no divergent transitions, no $\\hat{R} > 1.05$, and visual inspection confirmed that the chains mixed well. We used weakly informative priors for the intercept, fixed effect, and standard deviations for all models.\n\n$$Intercept \\sim Normal(0.5, 0.5)$$\n$$b \\sim Normal(0, 1)$$\n$$\\sigma \\sim Gamma(1, 4)$$\n\n### Dichotomous Truth Judgments\nThe analysis was based on 112399 trials nested within 1576 subjects, 997 statements, and 14 procedures.\n\nTable \\@ref(tab:dichotomous-model-table) provides a summary of parameter estimates. As expected, the model indicated a significant fixed effect of repetition ($OR =$ 1.79, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [1.51, 2.12]). Notably, the standard deviation of the random slope of repetition was highest at the subject level ($\\sigma =$ 0.72, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.68, 0.77]), followed by the procedure level ($\\sigma =$ 0.28, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.18, 0.44]), and the statement level ($\\sigma =$ 0.13, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.03, 0.19]).\n\n(ref:dichotomous-model-table) Variance in the truth effect at different levels\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: (\\#tab:dichotomous-model-table) Parameter Estimates of the Dichotomous Model\n\n\nEffect   Grouping    Parameter        Estimate   l\\_95\\_CrI   u\\_95\\_CrI \n-------  ----------  ---------------  ---------  -----------  -----------\nfixed                Intercept        0.31       0.17         0.44       \nfixed                repeated         0.58       0.41         0.75       \nrandom   procedure   Intercept (sd)   0.20       0.11         0.32       \nrandom   procedure   repeated (sd)    0.28       0.18         0.44       \nrandom   statement   Intercept (sd)   0.88       0.84         0.93       \nrandom   statement   repeated (sd)    0.13       0.03         0.19       \nrandom   subject     Intercept (sd)   0.69       0.66         0.72       \nrandom   subject     repeated (sd)    0.72       0.68         0.77       \n\n<div custom-style='table-note'>\n*Note.* N = 112399; N Procedure = 14; N Subjects = 1576; N Statements = 997; l\\_95\\_CrI refers to the lower boundary of the 95\\% credible interval, u\\_95\\_CrI refers to the upper boundary\n</div>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Scale Truth Judgments\nThe analysis was based on 572775 trials nested within 8309 subjects, 2872 statements, and 65 procedures.\n\nTable \\@ref(tab:scale-model-table) provides a summary of parameter estimates. As expected, the model indicated a significant fixed effect of repetition ($b =$ 0.08, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.07, 0.10]). Again, the standard deviation of the random slope of repetition was highest at the subject level ($\\sigma =$ 0.10, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.10, 0.10]), followed by the procedure level ($\\sigma =$ 0.07, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.05, 0.08]), and the statement level ($\\sigma =$ 0.03, $95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.02, 0.03]).\n\n(ref:scale-model-table) Variance in the truth effect at different levels\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: (\\#tab:scale-model-table) Parameter Estimates of the Scale Model\n\n\nEffect   Grouping    Parameter        Estimate   l\\_95\\_CrI   u\\_95\\_CrI \n-------  ----------  ---------------  ---------  -----------  -----------\nfixed                Intercept        0.54       0.52         0.56       \nfixed                repeated         0.08       0.07         0.10       \nrandom   procedure   Intercept (sd)   0.07       0.06         0.09       \nrandom   procedure   repeated (sd)    0.07       0.05         0.08       \nrandom   statement   Intercept (sd)   0.11       0.11         0.12       \nrandom   statement   repeated (sd)    0.03       0.02         0.03       \nrandom   subject     Intercept (sd)   0.10       0.09         0.10       \nrandom   subject     repeated (sd)    0.10       0.10         0.10       \n\n<div custom-style='table-note'>\n*Note.* N = 587999; N Procedure = 66; N Subjects = 8397; N Statements = 2872; l\\_95\\_CrI refers to the lower boundary of the 95\\% credible interval, u\\_95\\_CrI refers to the upper boundary\n</div>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nTo further explore the influence of temporal delay between the exposure and judgment phases on inter-individual variability in the repetition effect, we included an interaction between subject and temporal delay (same-day vs. different day) in the random effect structure. The model then estimates two standard distributions for the random effect of repetition on the subject level. We can then investigate whether the difference in the standard deviation of the random effect of repetition on the subject-level is different depending on the temporal delay.\n\nTable \\@ref(tab:time-model-table) provides a summary of parameter estimates. The standard deviation of the random slope of repetition at the subject level for a same-day judgment phase was $\\sigma_0 =$ 0.11 ($95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.10, 0.11]). The standard deviation for the random slope on a later day judgment phase was $\\sigma_1 =$ 0.08 ($95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.08, 0.09]). The difference in standard deviations in the random effect of repetition at the subject level deviated substantially from zero $\\sigma_0 - \\sigma_1 =$ 0.02 ($95\\% \\ CrI =$ [0.02, 0.02]).\n\n(ref:time-model-table) Variance in the truth effect at different levels\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: (\\#tab:time-model-table) Parameter Estimates of the Time-based Scale Model\n\n\nEffect   Grouping             Parameter        Estimate   l\\_95\\_CrI   u\\_95\\_CrI \n-------  -------------------  ---------------  ---------  -----------  -----------\nfixed                         Intercept        0.54       0.52         0.56       \nfixed                         repeated         0.08       0.07         0.10       \nrandom   procedure            Intercept (sd)   0.07       0.06         0.09       \nrandom   procedure            repeated (sd)    0.07       0.06         0.08       \nrandom   statement            Intercept (sd)   0.11       0.11         0.12       \nrandom   statement            repeated (sd)    0.03       0.02         0.03       \nrandom   subject (same day)   Intercept (sd)   0.10       0.10         0.10       \nrandom   subject (same day)   repeated (sd)    0.11       0.10         0.11       \nrandom   subject (later)      Intercept (sd)   0.08       0.08         0.08       \nrandom   subject (later)      repeated (sd)    0.08       0.08         0.09       \n\n<div custom-style='table-note'>\n*Note.* N = 587999; N Procedure = 66; N Subjects = 9592; N Statements = 2872; l\\_95\\_CrI refers to the lower boundary of the 95\\% credible interval, u\\_95\\_CrI refers to the upper boundary\n</div>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(ref:time-model-plot) Variance in the truth effect at different levels\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:time-model-plot)](explore_files/figure-html/time-model-plot-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
