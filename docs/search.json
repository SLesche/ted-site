    "text": "Abstract\nProcessing fluency, the experienced ease of ongoing mental operations, influences judgments such as frequency, monetary value, or truth. Most experiments keep to-be-judged stimuli ambiguous with regards to these judgment dimensions. In real life, however, people usually have declarative information about these stimuli beyond the experiential processing information. Here, we address how experiential fluency information may inform truth judgments in the presence of declarative advice information. Four experiments show that fluency influences judged truth even when advice about the statements’ truth is continuously available and labelled as highly valid; the influence follows a linear cue integration pattern for two orthogonal cues (i.e., experiential and declarative information). These data underline the importance of processing fluency as an explanatory construct in real-life judgements and support a cue integration framework to understand fluency effects in judgment and decision making."

    "text": "Abstract\nEase of processing—cognitive fluency—is a central input in assessments of truth, but little is known about individual differences in susceptibility to fluency-based biases in truth assessment. Focusing on two paradigms—truthiness and the illusory truth effect—we consider the role of Need for Cognition (NFC), an individual difference variable capturing one’s preference for elaborative thought. Across five experiments, we replicated basic truthiness and illusory truth effects. We found very little evidence that NFC moderates truthiness. However, we found some evidence that (without an experimental warning), people high on NFC may be more susceptible to the illusory truth effect. This may reflect that elaborative thought increases the fluency with which encoded statements are processed after a delay (thus increasing the illusory truth effect). Future research may fruitfully test whether the influence of NFC and other individual difference measures depends on whether people are making immediate or delayed truth judgments."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nDue to the information overload in today’s digital age, people maysometimes feel pressured to process and judge information especially fast. Inthree experiments, we examined whether time pressure increases therepetition-based truth effect — the tendency to judge repeatedlyencountered statements more likely as “true” than novelstatements. Based on the Heuristic-Systematic Model, a dual-process model in thefield of persuasion research, we expected that time pressure would boost thetruth effect by increasing reliance on processing fluency as a presumablyheuristic cue for truth, and by decreasing knowledge retrieval as a presumablyslow and systematic process that determines truth judgments. However, contraryto our expectation, time pressure did not moderate the truth effect.Importantly, this was the case for difficult statements, for which most peoplelack prior knowledge, as well as for easy statements, for which most people holdrelevant knowledge. Overall, the findings clearly speak against the conceptionof fast, fluency-based truth judgments versus slow, knowledge-based truthjudgments. In contrast, the results are compatible with a referential theory ofthe truth effect that does not distinguish between different types of truthjudgments. Instead, it assumes that truth judgments rely on the coherence oflocalized networks in people’s semantic memory, formed by both repetitionand prior knowledge."

    "text": "Abstract\nRecent evidence suggests that judgment biases may diminish when a problem is presented in a foreign language. This foreign-language effect has primarily been examined with emotional materials such as risky-choice problems and moral dilemmas. In two experiments, we investigated the effect of foreign-language processing on an emotionally neutral judgment bias: the repetition-based truth effect, the phenomenon that statement repetition enhances the perceived truth of statements. In Experiment 1, we found no evidence for the truth effect to be moderated by the language in which the statements were processed (native language: Hungarian; foreign language: English). In Experiment 2, in turn, we not only manipulated language (native language: German; foreign language: English), but also the retention interval between statement repetitions. Replicating the findings of Experiment 1, language did not moderate the truth effect for statements that were repeated within the same experimental session. However, after a two-week interval, the truth effect was significantly smaller in the foreign-language condition than in the native-language condition. Overall, our findings suggest a faster decay of semantic memory for foreign-language as compared to native-language statements."

    "text": "Abstract\nRepeatedly seen or heard statements are typically judged to be more valid than statements one has never encountered before. This phenomenon has been referred to as the truth effect. We conducted two experiments to assess the plasticity of the truth effect under different contextual conditions. Surprisingly, we did not find a truth effect in the typical judgment design when using a ten minutes interval between statement repetitions. However, we replicated the truth effect when changing the judgment task at initial statement exposure or when using an interval of one week rather than ten minutes. Because none of the current truth effect theories can fully account for these context effects, we conclude that the cognitive processes underlying truth judgments are more complex than has hitherto been assumed. To close the theoretical gap, we propose a revised fluency attribution hypothesis as a possible explanation of our findings."

    "text": "Abstract\nFact-checking organizations have reported that Donald Trump is prone to repeating patently false statements. Previous research has shown that repetition increases perceived truthfulness of even implausible statements (also known as the illusory truth effect). However, other research has shown that people may engage in motivated reasoning when interacting with someone from a different ideological group. We measured the effect of repeating statements made by Donald Trump on perceived truthfulness. Participants (N = 465) rated the truthfulness of different statements made by Donald Trump, some of which were repeated from an earlier phase of the experiment. Our results are striking. We observe an overall effect of repetition on perceived truthfulness that is equally robust regardless of political affiliation. Our results suggest that ideologically-motivated beliefs do not modulate the effect of repetition on perceived truthfulness of statements."

    "text": "Abstract\nA single exposure to statements is typically enough to increase their perceived truth. This Truth-by-Repetition (TBR) effect has long been assumed to occur only with statements whose truth value is unknown to participants. Contrary to this hypothesis, recent research has found that statements contradicting participants’ prior knowledge (as established from a first sample of participants) show a TBR effect following their repetition (in a second, independent sample of participants). As for now, however, attempts at finding a TBR effect for blatantly false (i.e., highly implausible) statements have failed. Here, we reasoned that highly implausible statements such as Elephants run faster than cheetahs may show repetition effects, provided a sensitive truth measure is used and statements are repeated more than just once. In a preregistered experiment, participants judged on a 100-point scale the truth of highly implausible statements that were either new to them or had been presented five times before judgment. We observed an effect of repetition: repeated statements were judged more true than new ones, although all judgments were judged below the scale midpoint. Exploratory analyses additionally show that about half the participants showed no or even a reversed effect of repetition. The results provide the first empirical evidence that repetition can increase perceived truth even for highly implausible statements, although not equally so for all participants and not to the point of making the statements look true."

    "text": "Abstract\nRepeated statements are rated as subjectively truer than comparable new statements, even though repetition alone provides no new, probative information (the illusory truth effect). Contrary to some theoretical predictions, the illusory truth effect seems to be similar in magnitude for repetitions occurring after minutes or weeks. This Registered Report describes a longitudinal investigation of the illusory truth effect (n = 608, n = 567 analysed) in which we systematically manipulated intersession interval (immediately, one day, one week, and one month) in order to test whether the illusory truth effect is immune to time. Both our hypotheses were supported: We observed an illusory truth effect at all four intervals (overall effect: χ2(1) = 169.91; Mrepeated = 4.52, Mnew = 4.14; H1), with the effect diminishing as delay increased (H2). False information repeated over short timescales might have a greater effect on truth judgements than repetitions over longer timescales. Researchers should consider the implications of the choice of intersession interval when designing future illusory truth effect research."

    "text": "Abstract\nRepetition increases the likelihood that a statement will be judged as true. This illusory truth effect is well established; however, it has been argued that repetition will not affect belief in unambiguous statements. When individuals are faced with obviously true or false statements, repetition should have no impact. We report a simulation study and a preregistered experiment that investigate this idea. Contrary to many intuitions, our results suggest that belief in all statements is increased by repetition. The observed illusory truth effect is largest for ambiguous items, but this can be explained by the psychometric properties of the task, rather than an underlying psychological mechanism that blocks the impact of repetition for implausible items. Our results indicate that the illusory truth effect is highly robust and occurs across all levels of plausibility. Therefore, even highly implausible statements will become more plausible with enough repetition."

Despite the widespread (harmful) implications and strategic use of this truth-by-repetition effect (TBRE), little is known about whether the effect is uniform across individuals. Across two longitudinal experiments (N1 = 113; N2 = 430), each consisting of five sessions spanning over 33 days, we collected 108,600 truth judgments. Results showed a trait-like TBRE: We found substantial individual differences in the TBRE, which were reliable and stable over time. The effect varied from being practically absent to being large, and we found no evidence for stable reversals; repetition did not meaningfully decrease believability among some individuals. Differences in the TBRE were modestly predicted by people’s Preference for Fluency. The results challenge the idea of a universal TBRE; Repetition increases the believability of information – but not for everyone, and more so for some than others."

In three pre-registered experiments, we show that repetition may also increase perceptions that statements are used as fake news on social media, irrespective of the factual truth or falsehood of the statements (Experiment 1 & 2), but that repetition reduces perceptions of falsehood when the context of judgment is left unspecified (Experiment 3). On a theoretical level, the findings support an ecological account of repetition effects, as opposed to either a fluency-as-positivity or to an amplification account of these effects. On a practical level, they qualify the influence of repetition on the perception of fake news."

They will be updated as new data is included and may thus deviate from the published results. On this page, you can find an overview of included data, a brief meta-analysis on the truth effect within TED, and additional models estimating variability in the truth effect on subject, statement, or experiment level.\nIn the current version of TED, we included 56 studies from 27 publications, spanning 12002 participants contributing 778741 trials. A complete list of the included publications can be found in the Table “overview of studies included in TED”.\nSample composition ranged from 29 to 949 participants. On average, studies included 218.04 participants (\\(\\mu_{age} =\\) 33.17,\\(\\sigma_{age} =\\) 7.22). An overview of the rating scale usage for truth judgments and the use of a filler task over all included studies can be found in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of Study-related variables in TED\n\n\n\n\nOn average, studies employed 62.90 (\\(SD =\\) 39.97) statements per participant in the judgment session and in 88.64 % of procedure settings exactly 50% of statements were repeated. Of 88 judgment phases, 75.00 % were conducted on the same day as the exposure phase. The average delay between exposure and judgment phase if both were conducted on the same day was 3.77 minutes. The average delay between exposure and judgment phase, given the judgment phase was conducted at least one day after the exposure phase, was 7.45 days.

    "text": "Meta-Analysis\nThe following provides an illustrative meta-analysis of effect sizes derived from the TED Truth Effect database. It is based on trial-level data and demonstrates how a meta-analysis could be conducted. This example is not a definitive guide, nor does TED represent a comprehensive or random sample of all studies, since it only includes studies with openly available trial-level data.\nHere, we included only studies with a heterogeneous presentation criterion (“between-items criterion”; Dechene et al., 2010). Effect sizes were calculated using Hedges’ g, derived as follows:\n\nFor each subject within a study, the repeated and new average responses were calculated.\nHedges’ g was computed per study using the effsize::cohen.d() function with the paired correction.\nVariances of the effect sizes were extracted to serve as input for the meta-analysis.\nThe meta-analysis accounts for multiple entries per publication (as some publications have multiple studies).\n\nSome small deviations from the originally reported effect sizes in the individual studies may exist. But we applied no additional exclusion criteria and tried to exclude (during encoding) all subjects excluded in the original studies.\nFirst, we access the database and retrieve trial-level data:\n\nlibrary(acdcquery)\n\n# Replace with your local path\nconn &lt;- connect_to_db(\"path/to/ted.db\")\n\nanalysis_data &lt;- query_db(\n    conn,\n    arguments,\n    target_vars = c(\"default\", \"study_id\", \"publication_id\", \"authors\", \"conducted\"),\n    target_table = \"observation_table\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  filter(phase == \"test\") %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(repeated), !is.na(response)) \n\n# Here we only use data where the test phase has both \n# repeated and new statements\nhas_complete_data &lt;- analysis_data %&gt;% \n  count(procedure_id, subject, repeated) %&gt;% \n  count(procedure_id, subject) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    has_complete_data = ifelse(n == 2, 1, 0)\n  )\n\nanalysis_data &lt;- analysis_data %&gt;% \n  left_join(\n    ., has_complete_data\n  ) %&gt;% \n  filter(has_complete_data == 1) \n\nThen we compute effect sizes per study using cohen.d.\n\neff_data &lt;- analysis_data %&gt;% \n  left_join(publications_overview) %&gt;% \n  group_by(publication_id, authors, conducted, study_id, repeated, subject) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\n    mean_resp = mean(response, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(repeated = factor(\n    ifelse(repeated &gt; 0, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n    levels = c(\"yes\", \"no\"))\n    ) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = repeated, values_from = mean_resp) %&gt;% \n  group_by(publication_id, authors, conducted, study_id) %&gt;% \n  nest() %&gt;% \n  mutate(effsize = map(\n    data, \n    ~effsize::cohen.d(\n      .$yes, \n      .$no, \n      data = ., \n      hedges.correction = TRUE,\n      paired = TRUE\n      )\n    )\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    estimate = map_dbl(effsize, ~{.$estimate}),\n    var = map_dbl(effsize, ~{.$var})\n  )\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(publication_id)`\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'publication_id', 'authors', 'conducted',\n'study_id', 'repeated'.

    "text": "Hierachical Bayesian Model\nTo illustrate the benefits of our large collection of trial-level data, we fitted Bayesian multilevel models predicting truth judgments, with repetition as a fixed effect and random intercepts and slopes at the subject, statement, and procedure levels.\nWe grouped data at the level of the procedure_table, as this table contains detailed information about each experimental setup (e.g., proportion of repeated items, presence of warnings, number of sessions) beyond what is available in the broader study_table. Each entry in the study_table corresponds to at least one entry in the procedure_table, but a single study may include several procedures that differ in these settings. For example, the same study may have multiple judgment sessions, modify the percentage of repeated stimuli, or warn some participants about the truth effect. These different procedures will then also receive different procedure identifiers, but the same study identifier.\nThus, the procedure identifier (procedure_id) uniquely captures both the study context and its specific experimental conditions. This modeling approach allows us to estimate the variance in the truth effect at three levels simultaneously: (1) variance due to common experimental manipulations and study settings (procedure level), (2) variance due to individual statements (statement level), and (3) variance due to individual differences (subject level).\nWe analyzed the dichotomous and Likert-type response formats separately due to differences in their scale characteristics. Dichotomous responses (e.g., true/false) require logistic models, whereas Likert-type responses (e.g., 1–5 ratings) allow for linear models. All responses were maximum-normalized to the range 0-1 with one representing the maximum possible response indicating a “true” judgment. The repetition status was mean-centered to aid model estimation, a new statement was coded -0.5 and a repeated statement 0.5.\nWe ran all models using 4 chains with 3000 iterations per chain, 1000 of which were discarded as warmup-samples, leading to a total of 8000 posterior samples. There were no divergent transitions, no \\(\\hat{R} &gt; 1.05\\), and visual inspection confirmed that the chains mixed well. We used weakly informative priors for the intercept, fixed effect, and standard deviations for all models.\n\\[Intercept \\sim Normal(0.5, 0.5)\\] \\[b \\sim Normal(0, 1)\\] \\[\\sigma \\sim Gamma(1, 4)\\]\n\nDichotomous Truth Judgments\nThe analysis was based on 112399 trials nested within 1576 subjects, 997 statements, and 14 procedures.\nThe table below provides a summary of parameter estimates. As expected, the model indicated a significant fixed effect of repetition (\\(OR =\\) 1.79, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [1.51, 2.12]). Notably, the standard deviation of the random slope of repetition was highest at the subject level (\\(\\sigma =\\) 0.72, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.68, 0.77]), followed by the procedure level (\\(\\sigma =\\) 0.28, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.18, 0.44]), and the statement level (\\(\\sigma =\\) 0.13, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.03, 0.19]).\n\n\n\nVariance in the truth effect at different levels\n\n\nEffect\nGrouping\nParameter\nEstimate\nl_95_CrI\nu_95_CrI\n\n\n\n\nfixed\n\nIntercept\n0.31\n0.17\n0.44\n\n\nfixed\n\nrepeated\n0.58\n0.41\n0.75\n\n\nrandom\nprocedure\nIntercept (sd)\n0.20\n0.11\n0.32\n\n\nrandom\nprocedure\nrepeated (sd)\n0.28\n0.18\n0.44\n\n\nrandom\nstatement\nIntercept (sd)\n0.88\n0.84\n0.93\n\n\nrandom\nstatement\nrepeated (sd)\n0.13\n0.03\n0.19\n\n\nrandom\nsubject\nIntercept (sd)\n0.69\n0.66\n0.72\n\n\nrandom\nsubject\nrepeated (sd)\n0.72\n0.68\n0.77\n\n\n\n\nNote.

As expected, the model indicated a significant fixed effect of repetition (\\(b =\\) 0.08, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.07, 0.10]). Again, the standard deviation of the random slope of repetition was highest at the subject level (\\(\\sigma =\\) 0.10, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.10, 0.10]), followed by the procedure level (\\(\\sigma =\\) 0.07, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.05, 0.08]), and the statement level (\\(\\sigma =\\) 0.03, \\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.02, 0.03]).\n\n\n\nVariance in the truth effect at different levels\n\n\nEffect\nGrouping\nParameter\nEstimate\nl_95_CrI\nu_95_CrI\n\n\n\n\nfixed\n\nIntercept\n0.54\n0.52\n0.56\n\n\nfixed\n\nrepeated\n0.08\n0.07\n0.10\n\n\nrandom\nprocedure\nIntercept (sd)\n0.07\n0.06\n0.09\n\n\nrandom\nprocedure\nrepeated (sd)\n0.07\n0.05\n0.08\n\n\nrandom\nstatement\nIntercept (sd)\n0.11\n0.11\n0.12\n\n\nrandom\nstatement\nrepeated (sd)\n0.03\n0.02\n0.03\n\n\nrandom\nsubject\nIntercept (sd)\n0.10\n0.09\n0.10\n\n\nrandom\nsubject\nrepeated (sd)\n0.10\n0.10\n0.10\n\n\n\n\nNote.

The model then estimates two standard distributions for the random effect of repetition on the subject level. We can then investigate whether the difference in the standard deviation of the random effect of repetition on the subject-level is different depending on the temporal delay.\nThe table below provides a summary of parameter estimates. The standard deviation of the random slope of repetition at the subject level for a same-day judgment phase was \\(\\sigma_0 =\\) 0.11 (\\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.10, 0.11]). The standard deviation for the random slope on a later day judgment phase was \\(\\sigma_1 =\\) 0.08 (\\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.08, 0.09]). The difference in standard deviations in the random effect of repetition at the subject level deviated substantially from zero \\(\\sigma_0 - \\sigma_1 =\\) 0.02 (\\(95\\% \\ CrI =\\) [0.02, 0.02]).\n\n\n\nVariance in the truth effect at different levels\n\n\nEffect\nGrouping\nParameter\nEstimate\nl_95_CrI\nu_95_CrI\n\n\n\n\nfixed\n\nIntercept\n0.54\n0.52\n0.56\n\n\nfixed\n\nrepeated\n0.08\n0.07\n0.10\n\n\nrandom\nprocedure\nIntercept (sd)\n0.07\n0.06\n0.09\n\n\nrandom\nprocedure\nrepeated (sd)\n0.07\n0.06\n0.08\n\n\nrandom\nstatement\nIntercept (sd)\n0.11\n0.11\n0.12\n\n\nrandom\nstatement\nrepeated (sd)\n0.03\n0.02\n0.03\n\n\nrandom\nsubject (same day)\nIntercept (sd)\n0.10\n0.10\n0.10\n\n\nrandom\nsubject (same day)\nrepeated (sd)\n0.11\n0.10\n0.11\n\n\nrandom\nsubject (later)\nIntercept (sd)\n0.08\n0.08\n0.08\n\n\nrandom\nsubject (later)\nrepeated (sd)\n0.08\n0.08\n0.09\n\n\n\n\nNote.

Repeated statements feel easier to process, and thus truer, than new ones. Surprisingly, this illusory truth effect occurs even when claims contradict young adults’ stored knowledge (e.g., repeating The fastest land animal is the leopard makes it more believable). In four experiments, we tackled this problem by prompting people to behave like “fact checkers.” Focusing on accuracy at exposure (giving initial truth ratings) wiped out the illusion later, but only when participants held relevant knowledge. This selective benefit persisted over a delay. Our findings inform theories of how people evaluate truth and suggest practical strategies for coping in a “post-truth world.”"

In five experiments (N = 1,344), we examined the TBRE in multilingual contexts (Belgium, Spain, United States, Mexico). We found that the TBRE emerges in the nonnative language and is as strong as the TBRE in the native language. Furthermore, we found a “cross-language” TBRE: repetition increases the subjective truth even if the language changes between repetitions, and this cross-language effect is as strong as the effect within the same language, be it in a nonnative or the native language. Theoretically, these results support TBRE accounts based on a conceptual mechanism. Practically, the results highlight the pervasive potential of the TBRE in a globalized world where many people consume information in different languages."

    "text": "Abstract\nMisinformation often continues to influence inferential reasoning after clear and credible corrections are provided; this effect is known as the continued influence effect. It has been theorized that this effect is partly driven by misinformation familiarity. Some researchers have even argued that a correction should avoid repeating the misinformation, as the correction itself could serve to inadvertently enhance misinformation familiarity and may thus backfire, ironically strengthening the very misconception it aims to correct. While previous research has found little evidence of such familiarity backfire effects, there remains one situation where they may yet arise: when correcting entirely novel misinformation, where corrections could serve to spread misinformation to new audiences. The present paper presents three experiments (total N = 1,718) investigating the possibility of familiarity backfire within the context of correcting novel misinformation claims. While there was variation across experiments, overall there was substantial evidence against familiarity backfire. Corrections that repeated novel misinformation claims did not lead to stronger misconceptions compared to a control group never exposed to the false claims or corrections. This suggests that it is safe to repeat misinformation when correcting it, even when the audience might be unfamiliar with the misinformation."

In two experiments, Italian-English (n = 80) and Greek-English (n = 66), unbalanced bilinguals were exposed to 60 written unknown trivia statements in English. After a distractor math task, participants rated the truthfulness of the same 60 (repeated) statements and 60 new statements, which were presented either in the same language as in the exposure phase (English) or in a different language (Italian, Experiment 1, or Greek, Experiment 2). Response times were faster when information was repeated in the same language compared to a different language, suggesting increased processing fluency in the former than in the latter case. Truth ratings yielded an illusory truth effect: repeated statements were considered more truthful than new statements. Interestingly, the magnitude of the illusory truth effect remained regardless of whether the repetition was in the same or in a different language and persisted even when the different language condition also entailed a different script (Latin in exposure phase and Greek in repetition). The results suggest that the language of information presentation is not a critical factor to affect the illusory truth effect, despite the fact that repetition in the same language increases processing speed. We interpret our results in light of the referential theory (Unkelbach & Rom, Cognition 160: 110–126, 2017), attributing the illusory truth effect to conceptual fluency induced by the overlap of activated conceptual representations in bilingual memory."

    "text": "Abstract\nInformation is judged as more true when it has been seen or heard repeatedly than when it is new. This illusory truth effect has important consequences in the real world, where we are repeatedly exposed to information of unknown veracity. While false information in natural contexts rarely comes with a warning label, false information in truth effect experiments often does. Commonly used experimental procedures alert participants to potential falsehoods at exposure through instructional warnings. Three experiments show that the size of the truth effect is over twice as large when such warnings are avoided. The influence of pre-exposure warnings on the size of the truth effect persists even after a delay of three to six days. These findings demonstrate that common experimental procedures invite a systematic underestimation of illusory truth effects. They also highlight that simple warnings can curb the impact of repetition on judgments of truth."

Contrary to some theoretical predictions, the illusory truth effect seems to be similar in magnitude for repetitions occurring after minutes or weeks. This Registered Report describes a longitudinal investigation of the illusory truth effect (n = 608, n = 567 analysed) in which we systematically manipulated intersession interval (immediately, one day, one week, and one month) in order to test whether the illusory truth effect is immune to time. Both our hypotheses were supported: We observed an illusory truth effect at all four intervals (overall effect: χ2(1) = 169.91; Mrepeated = 4.52, Mnew = 4.14; H1), with the effect diminishing as delay increased (H2). False information repeated over short timescales might have a greater effect on truth judgements than repetitions over longer timescales. Researchers should consider the implications of the choice of intersession interval when designing future illusory truth effect research."

    "text": "Abstract\nTypically, people are more likely to consider a previously seen or heard statement as true compared to a novel statement. This repetition-based “truth effect” is thought to rely on fluency-truth attributions as the underlying cognitive mechanism. In two experiments, we tested the nature of the fluency-attribution mechanism by means of warning instructions, which informed participants about the truth effect and asked them to prevent it. In Experiment 1, we instructed warned participants to consider whether a statement had already been presented in the experiment to avoid the truth effect. However, warnings did not significantly reduce the truth effect. In Experiment 2, we introduced control questions and reminders to ensure that participants understood the warning instruction. This time, warning reduced, but did not eliminate the truth effect. Assuming that the truth effect relies on fluency-truth attributions, this finding suggests that warned participants could control their attributions but did not disregard fluency altogether when making truth judgments. Further, we found no evidence that participants overdiscount the influence of fluency on their truth judgments."

    "text": "Abstract\nTo better understand the spread of fake news in the Internet age, it is important to uncover the variables that influence the perceived truth of information. Although previous research identified several reliable predictors of truth judgments—such as source credibility, repeated information exposure, and presentation format—little is known about their simultaneous effects. In a series of four experiments, we investigated how the abovementioned factors jointly affect the perceived truth of statements (Experiments 1 and 2) and simulated social media postings (Experiments 3 and 4). Experiment 1 explored the role of source credibility (high vs. low vs. no source information) and presentation format (with vs. without a picture). In Experiments 2 and 3, we additionally manipulated repeated exposure (yes vs. no). Finally, Experiment 4 examined the role of source credibility (high vs. low) and type of repetition (congruent vs. incongruent vs. no repetition) in further detail. In sum, we found no effect of presentation format on truth judgments, but strong, additive effects of source credibility and repetition. Truth judgments were higher for information presented by credible sources than non-credible sources and information without sources. Moreover, congruent (i.e., verbatim) repetition increased perceived truth whereas semantically incongruent repetition decreased perceived truth, irrespectively of the source. Our findings show that people do not rely on a single judgment cue when evaluating a statement’s truth but take source credibility and their meta-cognitive feelings into account."

    "text": "Abstract\nRepeatedly seen or heard statements are typically judged to be more likely true than statements not encountered before, a phenomenon referred to as truth effect. Similarly, statements judged to be old typically receive higher truth judgments than statements judged to be new. However, it is unclear whether and how this recognition-based truth effect depends on the latent memory states underlying observed recognition judgments. In order to investigate this question, we used a model-based approach to compare truth judgments as a function of recognition judgments (“old” vs. “new”) and their underlying memory states (state of memory certainty vs. state of uncertainty). In three experiments, we observed a recognition-based truth effect and found this effect to be larger in the state of memory certainty than in the state of uncertainty. This result also replicated for subjective instead of modeled memory states. Moreover, we found effects of recognition judgments on judged truth to be stronger than effects of factual repetition in all three experiments. Taken together, our research highlights the role of episodic memory processes in the truth effect and provides a methodological tool that takes underlying memory states into account."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe 2016 U.S. presidential election brought considerable attention to the phenomenon of “fake news”: entirely fabricated and often partisan content that is presented as factual. Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake-news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this “illusory truth effect” for fake-news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the reader’s political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. It is interesting, however, that we also found that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., “The earth is a perfect square”). These observations indicate that although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy. As a consequence, the scope and impact of repetition on beliefs is greater than has been previously assumed."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe eminent role of processing fluency in judgment and decision-making is undisputed. Not only is fluency affected by sources as diverse as stimulus repetition or visual clarity, but it also has an impact on outcomes as diverse as liking for a stimulus or the subjective validity of a statement. Although several studies indicate that sources and outcomes are widely interchangeable, recent research suggests that judgments are differentially affected by conceptual and perceptual fluency, with stronger effects of conceptual (vs. perceptual) fluency on judgments of truth. Here, we propose a fluency-specificity hypothesis according to which conceptual fluency is more informative for content-related judgments, but perceptual fluency is more informative for judgments related to perception. Two experimental studies in which perceptual and conceptual fluency were manipulated orthogonally show the superiority of content repetition on judgments of truth but the superiority of visual contrast on aesthetic evaluations. The theoretical implications are discussed."
